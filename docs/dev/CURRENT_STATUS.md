# Current Status (NyayaSetu MVP)

## V2 Optimizations Completed
- **Latency Optimization**: Reduced response times from 35s to ~2s using Groq API and `@st.cache_resource` for ML initialization.
- **Citation Hallucination Fix**: Completely removed the unreliable LLM formatting constraints. Python now extracts the `evidence_quote` from the JSON response, string-matches it against the ChromaDB `hits`, and directly injects the authoritative `case_id` from the ChromaDB metadata payload. 
- **Database Architecture**: ChromaDB successfully stores `case_id`, `court`, `title`, `date`, and `section` natively on ingestion. No database migrations were required.
- **Fallback Loop Removal**: The costly 48-second `CITATION_REMINDER` retry loop has been entirely deleted from `rag_chain.py` as it is no longer necessary.

## Health Check
- `evaluate_rag.py` passes 100% citation verification (0 unverified).
- Out of scope questions (Q12-Q15) are successfully denied.
- Streamlit application renders both Groq and Ollama pathways perfectly.

## Next Steps / Future Roadmap
- Scale dataset to include more complex Section 138 scenarios.
- Explore production deployment configurations (Dockerizing the SQLite + Chroma databases).
